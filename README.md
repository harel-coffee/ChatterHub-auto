# ChatterHub: Privacy Invasion via Smart Home Hub

To address privacy invasion through smart-home devices, we present ChatterHub. This novel approach accurately identifies smart-home devices’ activities with minimal monitoring of encrypted traffic in the home network. ChatterHub targets devices that can only connect to the Internet through a centralized smart-home hub (e.g., Samsung SmartThings) using Zigbee or Z-wave. Specifically,Chatter Hub passively eavesdrops on encrypted network traffic from the hub and leverages machine learning techniques to classify events and states of smart-home devices. Using ChatterHub, an adversary can identify smart-home devices’specific activities without prior knowledge of the target smarthome (e.g., list of deployed devices, types of communication protocols).
